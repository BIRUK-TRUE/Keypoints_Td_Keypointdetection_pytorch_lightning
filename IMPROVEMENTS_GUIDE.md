# â”œâ”€â”€ annotations/
# â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ person_keypoints_train2017.json
# â”‚   â””â”€â”€ person_keypoints_val2017.json
# â””â”€â”€ images/
#     â”œâ”€â”€ train2017/
#     â””â”€â”€ val2017/
```

### 2. Run Training with Enhanced Configuration
```bash
python train.py --epochs 200 --learning_rate 3e-4
```

### 3. Monitor Training Progress

### Before vs After Comparison

| Parameter | Before | After | Reason |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| `batch_size` | 4 | 16 | Better gradient estimates |
| `learning_rate` | 1e-3 | 3e-4 | Optimal for AdamW |

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **CUDA Out of Memory**
   - Reduce batch size from 16 to 8 or 4
   - Enable gradient checkpointing if needed

2. **Slow Training**
   - Ensure `num_workers` is set appropriately in dataloader
   - Consider mixed precision training

3. **Poor Convergence**
   - Check dataset paths are correct
   - Verify augmentations aren't too aggressive
   - Monitor learning rate scheduling

4. **Low Accuracy**
   - Ensure missing images are properly handled
   - Verify heatmap sigma is appropriate for your resolution
   - Check that focal loss parameters suit your data distribution

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring Training

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Training Loss**: Should decrease smoothly with focal loss
- **Validation mAP**: Should improve significantly with enhancements
- **Learning Rate**: Should follow cosine annealing pattern
- **Gradient Norms**: Should be stable with clipping

### Expected Timeline
- **Epoch 1-25**: Initial learning with warm restart
- **Epoch 26-50**: First restart cycle, should see improvement
- **Epoch 51-100**: Continued refinement
- **Epoch 101-200**: Fine-tuning and convergence

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators
